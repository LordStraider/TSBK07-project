This is a learning project for a course at my university, just for fun.
I'm trying to learn OpenGL using C.

It's developed under Mac OS X 10.8.2
To run it you need Xcode installed.
I use: 
	http://ragnemalm.se/lightweight/ 
to compile and run the code, it's a lightweight editor that have basic functionallity from Xcode.
The sweet thing is that you don't need anything for it, no projects or anything - just the code!


But since it's OpenGL any platform should work, but that's not tested yet. 
But just add the correct librarys (Glut and OpenGL) and get a nice project and it should work...

=)

Anyway, have fun!
